## Data Flow

### Wallet Connection Check Pattern
All pages follow this pattern:
```typescript
const { address, isConnected } = useWallet();

if (!isConnected) {
  return (
    <div className="...">
      <h2>Connect Wallet to View [Page Name]</h2>
      <button>Connect Wallet</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Data Fetching Pattern
All pages use React Query hooks:
```typescript
// Fetch data with hooks
const { loans, isLoading } = useUserLoansWithHealth(address);
const { kusd, sbtc } = useTokenBalances(address);
const { data: stats } = useMarketplaceStats();
const { data: reputation, nextTier } = useReputationWithProgress(address);

// Loading state
{isLoading && <Spinner />}

// Display real data
{loans?.map(loan => ...)}
```

## Key Features

### 1. Real-Time Data
- All data auto-refreshes every 30 seconds
- Loans refresh every 30 seconds
- Reputation refreshes every 60 seconds
- Market stats refresh every 30 seconds

### 2. Unit Conversions
All data properly converted for display:
- kUSD: `microKusdToKusd()` - 1,000,000 micro-kUSD = $1 kUSD
- sBTC: `satoshisToSbtc()` - 100,000,000 satoshis = 1 sBTC
- APR: `basisPointsToPercent()` - 580 basis points = 5.8%
- Duration: `blocksToDays()` - 12,960 blocks = 90 days

### 3. Loading States
- Spinner animation while fetching data
- "Loading..." text with context
- Disabled buttons during load

### 4. Empty States
- "No active loans found" message with helpful icon
- "Connect Wallet" messages for unauthenticated users
- Contextual help text

### 5. Wallet-Gated Pages
- Dashboard, Loans, and Create pages require wallet connection
- User-friendly "Connect Wallet" messages
- Centered layout for better UX
