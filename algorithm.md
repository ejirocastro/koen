We are going to implement a time-based interest protocol for the lending pool.
The key points:

Lenders deposit kUSD and receive shares. The shares represent their portion of the pool.

The pool's total assets (kUSD) are the kUSD balance plus the total borrowed amount (which is owed by borrowers).

The exchange rate between shares and kUSD increases as interest is accrued.

How interest is accrued:

We will use a time-based interest model. The borrowing interest rate is determined by the pool utilization and the borrower's reputation.

The interest is accrued continuously (in practice, at every block) but we will update the interest in the pool state when actions occur (deposit, withdraw, borrow, repay, liquidate).

Steps for interest accrual:

We track the total borrowed amount and the last update block.

When an action occurs, we calculate the interest accrued since the last update.

The interest is added to the total borrowed amount (so the debt of each borrower increases proportionally?).

However, we are not tracking individual borrower's interest in this model. Instead, we are tracking the total borrowed and then the interest is allocated to the pool.

Alternatively, we can use an interest index for the pool.

Let me use a common method:

Let totalBorrows be the total amount of kUSD that is borrowed (without interest).
But we want to account for interest, so we use:

text
  totalBorrowsWithInterest = totalBorrows * interestIndex
And we update the interestIndex over time.

But note: we are using a share system for lenders, so the pool's value is:

text
  totalAssets = kUSD_balance + totalBorrowsWithInterest
And the exchange rate for lenders is:

text
  exchangeRate = totalAssets / totalShares
How to update the interestIndex?

text
  interestIndex = interestIndex * (1 + borrowingRate * timeDelta)
But we don't have floating point.

We can use:

text
  interestIndex = interestIndex * (1 + borrowingRate * timeDelta)  [in fixed point]
We can define:

text
  borrowingRate = utilization * multiplier + baseRate
And then:

text
  interestIndex = interestIndex + interestIndex * borrowingRate * timeDelta
But we are in Clarity, so we use integers.

We can use a scale for the interestIndex, e.g., 1e18.

Then:

text
  interestIndex = interestIndex * (1e18 + borrowingRate * timeDelta) / 1e18
But note: the borrowingRate is per block? We can define the borrowingRate per block.

Alternatively, we can define the borrowingRate per year and then convert to per block.

We have:

text
  blocksPerYear = 52560   (assuming 10-minute blocks: 6 * 24 * 365)

  borrowingRatePerBlock = borrowingRatePerYear / blocksPerYear
Then, the interestIndex is updated every block by:

text
  interestIndex = interestIndex * (1e18 + borrowingRatePerBlock * 1e18) / 1e18
But we don't update every block, we update on every action.

So, when an action occurs, we calculate the number of blocks since the last update and then update the interestIndex.

Then, the totalBorrowsWithInterest = totalBorrows * interestIndex / initialIndex (which is 1e18)

But note: we are not tracking the totalBorrows without interest, we are tracking the totalBorrows with interest?

Actually, we can track:

text
  totalBorrows: the total amount of kUSD that was borrowed (without interest) at the time of the last update.

  Then, when we update the interestIndex, we can update the totalBorrows to be the current totalBorrowsWithInterest and then reset the interestIndex to 1e18? 
Alternatively, we can use:

text
  totalBorrows = totalBorrows * interestIndex / oldInterestIndex
and then set the interestIndex to the new value.

But we are not tracking the totalBorrows per borrower.

We are going to track the totalBorrows for the pool and then the interestIndex.

Then, the debt of a borrower is:

text
  borrowerDebt = borrowerPrincipal * interestIndex / interestIndexAtBorrow
This is the common method in Compound and Aave.

However, for the hackathon, we can simplify:

text
  We don't track the interestIndex per borrower, but we track the totalBorrows and then the interest is allocated to the pool.
Since we are not allowing partial repayments and we are not having multiple borrowers with different borrow times, we can do:

text
  We update the totalBorrows by applying the interest since the last update.

  Then, the pool's totalAssets = kUSD_balance + totalBorrows

  Then, the exchange rate for lenders is totalAssets / totalShares.
How to update totalBorrows:

text
  Let `lastUpdateBlock` be the last block when the totalBorrows was updated.

  Let `borrowingRate` be the current borrowing rate (per block).

  Then, at the current block:

      blocksElapsed = currentBlock - lastUpdateBlock
      interest = totalBorrows * borrowingRate * blocksElapsed
      totalBorrows = totalBorrows + interest

  Then, update lastUpdateBlock to currentBlock.
This way, the totalBorrows increases over time, and the pool's totalAssets increases, so the exchange rate for lenders increases.

But note: the borrowingRate is the rate we charge borrowers, and it is based on the utilization.

How to set the borrowingRate?

text
  utilization = totalBorrows / (kUSD_balance + totalBorrows)

  borrowingRate = baseRate + utilization * multiplier
We can set:

text
  baseRate = 0.05% per block? -> 5% per year? Let's calculate:

  per block: 5% / 52560 = 0.000095% per block -> 0.00000095 in decimal.
But we are using integers, so we use basis points.

Let me define:

text
  baseRatePerYear = 500 (5% in basis points)
  multiplierPerYear = 1000 (10% in basis points)

  Then, per block:

      baseRatePerBlock = baseRatePerYear / blocksPerYear = 500 / 52560 = 0.00951 (but we are in basis points, so we multiply by 1e18 for precision)
Alternatively, we can define the rates in basis points per block, but they are very small.

We can define:

text
  baseRatePerBlock = 951    // 0.00951 basis points per block? But that is too small.
Actually, we can define the borrowingRate in basis points per year and then convert to per block by:

text
  borrowingRatePerBlock = borrowingRatePerYear * 1e18 / (blocksPerYear * 10000)   [because 1% = 100 basis points]
But note: we are using basis points for the rate, so 5% = 500 basis points.

Then, the interest per block for totalBorrows is:

text
  interest = totalBorrows * borrowingRatePerBlock / 1e18
We can set:

text
  blocksPerYear = 52560
  baseRatePerYear = 500   (5%)
  multiplierPerYear = 1000 (10%)

  Then, the borrowingRatePerYear = baseRatePerYear + utilization * multiplierPerYear

  Then, borrowingRatePerBlock = borrowingRatePerYear * 1e18 / (blocksPerYear * 10000)
But note: the utilization is between 0 and 1, so we represent it with 4 decimals?

Alternatively, we can define:

text
  utilization = (totalBorrows * 10000) / (kUSD_balance + totalBorrows)   [in basis points]

  Then, borrowingRatePerYear = baseRatePerYear + (utilization * multiplierPerYear) / 10000
Then, borrowingRatePerBlock = (borrowingRatePerYear * 1e18) / (blocksPerYear * 10000)

This is complex.

Given the time, we can use a fixed borrowing rate per block for the hackathon.

Let me set:

text
  borrowingRatePerBlock = 1000000000000   // 0.000001 (1e-6) per block, which is about 5.256% per year (0.000001 * 52560 * 100 = 5.256%)
Then, we update the totalBorrows:

text
  totalBorrows = totalBorrows + (totalBorrows * borrowingRatePerBlock * blocksElapsed) / 1e18
We'll use 1e18 for precision.

Steps:

text
  (define-constant PRECISION u1000000000000000000)   ;; 1e18

  (define-data-var total-borrows uint u0)
  (define-data-var last-update-block uint block-height)
  (define-constant BORROW_RATE_PER_BLOCK u1000000000000)   ;; 0.000001 * 1e18 = 1e12, but we are using 1e18 so 1e12 is 0.000001
Then, when we update:

text
  (let*
    (
      (current-block block-height)
      (blocks-elapsed (- current-block (var-get last-update-block)))
      (interest (/ (* (var-get total-borrows) BORROW_RATE_PER_BLOCK blocks-elapsed) PRECISION))
      (new-total-borrows (+ (var-get total-borrows) interest))
    )
    (var-set total-borrows new-total-borrows)
    (var-set last-update-block current-block)
  )
We do this update at the beginning of every function that changes the pool state (deposit, withdraw, borrow, repay, liquidate).

Then, the pool's total assets = kUSD_balance + total-borrows

Then, the exchange rate for lenders is:

text
  exchange-rate = (total-assets * PRECISION) / total-shares
But note: we are using PRECISION for the exchange rate as well.

When a lender deposits:

text
  shares = (amount * PRECISION) / exchange-rate
When a lender withdraws:

text
  amount = (shares * exchange-rate) / PRECISION
We'll initialize:

text
  total-shares = 0
  exchange-rate = PRECISION   (1e18, meaning 1 share = 1 kUSD)
Then, when we update the total-borrows, we update the exchange-rate.

However, note that the kUSD_balance changes when lenders deposit and withdraw, and when borrowers borrow and repay.

We track:

text
  kUSD-balance: the amount of kUSD held by the contract.
Then, total-assets = kUSD-balance + total-borrows

Then, exchange-rate = (total-assets * PRECISION) / total-shares

But if total-shares is zero, we set exchange-rate to PRECISION.

Now, let's outline the functions:

We assume we have:

text
  (define-data-var kUSD-balance uint u0)
  (define-data-var total-shares uint u0)
  (define-data-var exchange-rate uint PRECISION)
And we have the update function for the interest:

text
  (define-private (update-interest)
    ... as above ...
  )
Then, every public function first calls update-interest.

Now, the steps for each function:

deposit-kusd (amount):
update-interest
Check: amount > 0
Transfer kUSD from sender to contract
kUSD-balance = kUSD-balance + amount
total-assets = kUSD-balance + total-borrows
If total-shares == 0:
shares = amount
Else:
shares = (amount * PRECISION) / exchange-rate
total-shares = total-shares + shares
Update exchange-rate = (total-assets * PRECISION) / total-shares
Give shares to the lender

withdraw-kusd (shares):
update-interest
Check: user has at least shares
amount = (shares * exchange-rate) / PRECISION
Check: amount <= kUSD-balance
kUSD-balance = kUSD-balance - amount
total-shares = total-shares - shares
total-assets = kUSD-balance + total-borrows
Update exchange-rate = (total-assets * PRECISION) / total-shares
Transfer kUSD to user

borrow-kusd (amount):
update-interest
Check: user has sufficient collateral and reputation
Check: amount <= kUSD-balance
kUSD-balance = kUSD-balance - amount
total-borrows = total-borrows + amount
total-assets = kUSD-balance + total-borrows [unchanged because we are moving from kUSD-balance to total-borrows]
Update exchange-rate = (total-assets * PRECISION) / total-shares [unchanged because total-assets is the same]
Transfer kUSD to user

repay-kusd (amount):
update-interest
Check: user has at least that much debt
Transfer kUSD from user to contract
kUSD-balance = kUSD-balance + amount
total-borrows = total-borrows - amount
total-assets = kUSD-balance + total-borrows
Update exchange-rate = (total-assets * PRECISION) / total-shares
Update user's debt

Note: In borrow and repay, we are updating the total-borrows, which is used in the interest calculation.

Also, we are updating the exchange rate because the total-assets changes (but in borrow, the total-assets remains the same, so the exchange rate doesn't change?).

Actually, in borrow:
kUSD-balance decreases by amount
total-borrows increases by amount
total-assets = (kUSD-balance - amount) + (total-borrows + amount) = kUSD-balance + total-borrows -> unchanged.

So, the exchange rate doesn't change in borrow and repay?

But wait, in repay, we are increasing kUSD-balance and decreasing total-borrows by the same amount, so total-assets is unchanged.

Then, when does the exchange rate change?

The exchange rate changes when the total-borrows increases due to interest (in the update-interest function) and when lenders deposit or withdraw.

So, the interest is reflected in the increase of total-borrows, which increases the total-assets, and then the exchange rate increases.

This model works.

Now, we have to implement the collateral and borrowing power.

We track for each borrower:

text
  sbtc-collateral: uint
  kusd-debt: uint
But note: the kusd-debt is not updated with interest. We are tracking the total-borrows for the pool, but not per borrower.

How to update the borrower's debt?

We are not updating the borrower's debt with interest. Instead, we are updating the total-borrows and then the borrower's debt is the amount they borrowed plus the interest that has accrued on their loan.

But we are not tracking the interest per borrower.

Alternatively, we can use the same method as the pool: we track the borrower's debt and the interest index at the time of borrowing.

But for simplicity, we can avoid per borrower interest and instead use the pool's total-borrows to represent the total debt, and then when a borrower repays, they repay a portion of the total debt.

However, that is not fair because the interest is applied to the entire pool, and then each borrower's debt is calculated based on their share of the total debt.

We can do:

text
  total-borrows is the total debt of all borrowers including interest.

  Then, when a borrower borrows, we record the amount they borrowed and the total-borrows at that time? 
Alternatively, we can use:

text
  borrower's debt = borrower's principal * (current total-borrows / total-borrows-at-the-time-of-borrow)
But we are not tracking the total-borrows-at-the-time-of-borrow for each borrower.

Given the time, we can avoid per borrower interest and instead update the borrower's debt in the update-interest function.

But note: the update-interest function updates the total-borrows, but we are not updating the borrower's debt.

How to calculate the health factor for a borrower?

text
  We need the current debt of the borrower.
We can track:

text
  borrower's principal and the block when they borrowed.
Then, we can calculate the current debt as:

text
  currentDebt = principal * (1 + borrowingRate * blocksElapsed)
But we don't have the borrowingRate for the borrower, we have the pool's borrowingRate.

We can use the pool's borrowingRate and then update the borrower's debt every time we need to check the health factor.

Steps for a borrower:

text
  When they borrow, we record:

      borrower-principal = amount
      borrow-block = current-block

  Then, when we need the current debt:

      blocksElapsed = current-block - borrow-block
      interest = borrower-principal * borrowingRate * blocksElapsed
      currentDebt = borrower-principal + interest
But note: the borrowingRate is the same for all borrowers and is the pool's borrowingRate.

However, the borrowingRate changes over time with utilization.

So, we cannot use the borrowingRate at the time of borrow.

We must use the current borrowingRate?

Alternatively, we can update the borrower's debt every time the pool's borrowingRate changes.

This is complex.

Given the hackathon scope, we can use a fixed borrowing rate and then update the borrower's debt by:

text
  currentDebt = borrower-principal * (1 + fixedBorrowingRate * blocksElapsed)
But then, the borrowingRate is fixed, which is not realistic.

Alternatively, we can use the pool's total-borrows to represent the total debt, and then each borrower's debt is proportional to their share of the total principal.

But we are not tracking the total principal, we are tracking the total-borrows which includes interest.

We can track:

text
  total-principal: the sum of all borrower principals.

  Then, the interest is allocated to each borrower proportionally.

  currentDebt of a borrower = (borrower-principal / total-principal) * total-borrows
But then, when a new borrower borrows, the total-principal increases, and the existing borrowers' share of the total debt decreases?

This is not correct.

Given the complexity and the hackathon time, I propose we use the following:

text
  We do not charge interest in the hackathon demo.
We focus on the reputation system and the liquidation.

We can add interest in a future version.

So, we remove the time-based interest for the hackathon.

We'll use a fixed fee on repayment, as in the previous design.

We'll charge a 1% fee on the repaid amount.

Then, the fee is added to the pool's kUSD-balance, and then the exchange rate increases.

This way, lenders earn the fee.

We'll implement:

text
  update-interest: does nothing.

  borrow: no interest.

  repay: charge a 1% fee.
Then, the total-assets = kUSD-balance + total-borrows + fee-collected

But note: the fee is collected and added to kUSD-balance, so the total-assets increases by the fee.

Then, the exchange rate increases.

This is simpler.

Let's revert to the fixed fee model.

We'll charge a fee of 1% on the repaid amount.

Steps for repay:

text
  fee = (amount * FEE_RATE) / 10000   [FEE_RATE = 100 for 1%]

  total-repay = amount + fee

  Transfer total-repay from borrower to contract.

  kUSD-balance += total-repay
  total-borrows -= amount

  Then, update the exchange rate.
This way, the fee is distributed to all lenders.

We'll remove the time-based interest.

So, the final design is:

text
  No time-based interest.

  Fixed 1% fee on repayment.

  Reputation-based borrowing limits.

  Liquidations based on health factor.
We'll implement the share system for lenders with an exchange rate that updates when:

text
  - Lender deposits
  - Lender withdraws
  - Borrower repays (because fee is added)
And also when a borrower borrows or repays, the total-assets changes, but note:

text
  When borrow: kUSD-balance decreases, total-borrows increases -> total-assets unchanged.

  When repay: kUSD-balance increases by (amount + fee), total-borrows decreases by amount -> total-assets increases by fee.
So, the exchange rate updates only when lenders deposit, withdraw, or when a fee is collected.

We can update the exchange rate in the borrow and repay functions even though it doesn't change in borrow, but for consistency, we can update it in every function.

We'll update the exchange rate in every function that changes kUSD-balance or total-borrows.

Now, let's write the code.

We'll break the code into sections.

We'll assume:

text
  - kUSD token contract is already deployed and we have the trait.

  - Reputation SBT contract is already deployed.

  - Mock sBTC token is deployed.
We'll define:

text
  (define-constant FEE_RATE u100)   ;; 1% in basis points
We'll track:

text
  (define-data-var kUSD-balance uint u0)
  (define-data-var total-borrows uint u0)
  (define-data-var total-shares uint u0)
  (define-data-var exchange-rate uint PRECISION)

  (define-map lender-shares principal uint)
  (define-map borrower-positions principal {sbtc-collateral: uint, kusd-debt: uint})
We'll have a function to update the exchange rate:

text
  (define-private (update-exchange-rate)
    (let ((total-assets (+ (var-get kUSD-balance) (var-get total-borrows))))
      (if (is-eq (var-get total-shares) u0)
        (var-set exchange-rate PRECISION)
        (var-set exchange-rate (/ (* total-assets PRECISION) (var-get total-shares)))
      )
    )
  )
Then, in every public function, we call update-exchange-rate at the beginning.

Now, the functions:

deposit-kusd (amount):
(update-exchange-rate)
(try! (token-transfer? kUSD-token tx-sender (as-contract tx-sender) amount))
(set! kUSD-balance (+ (var-get kUSD-balance) amount))
(let ((shares (if (is-eq (var-get total-shares) u0)
amount
(/ (* amount PRECISION) (var-get exchange-rate)))))
(set! total-shares (+ (var-get total-shares) shares))
(map-set lender-shares tx-sender (+ (default-to u0 (map-get? lender-shares tx-sender)) shares))
)
(update-exchange-rate)

withdraw-kusd (shares):

(let ((user-shares (default-to u0 (map-get? lender-shares tx-sender))))
(asserts! (<= shares user-shares) (err u101))
(let ((amount (/ (* shares (var-get exchange-rate)) PRECISION)))
(asserts! (<= amount (var-get kUSD-balance)) (err u102))
(set! kUSD-balance (- (var-get kUSD-balance) amount))
(set! total-shares (- (var-get total-shares) shares))
(map-set lender-shares tx-sender (- user-shares shares))
(try! (token-transfer? kUSD-token (as-contract tx-sender) tx-sender amount))
)
)
(update-exchange-rate)

deposit-sbtc (amount):
(update-exchange-rate)
(try! (token-transfer? sBTC-token tx-sender (as-contract tx-sender) amount))
(let ((position (default-to {sbtc-collateral: u0, kusd-debt: u0} (map-get? borrower-positions tx-sender))))
(map-set borrower-positions tx-sender (merge position {sbtc-collateral: (+ (get sbtc-collateral position) amount)}))
)
(update-exchange-rate)

withdraw-sbtc (amount):
(update-exchange-rate)
(let ((position (unwrap! (map-get? borrower-positions tx-sender) (err u103))))
(asserts! (>= (get sbtc-collateral position) amount) (err u104))
(asserts! (is-healthy? (merge position {sbtc-collateral: (- (get sbtc-collateral position) amount)})) (err u105))
(map-set borrower-positions tx-sender (merge position {sbtc-collateral: (- (get sbtc-collateral position) amount)}))
(try! (token-transfer? sBTC-token (as-contract tx-sender) tx-sender amount))
)
(update-exchange-rate)

borrow-kusd (amount):
(update-exchange-rate)
(let ((position (unwrap! (map-get? borrower-positions tx-sender) (err u103))))
(asserts! (<= amount (calculate-borrowing-power tx-sender)) (err u106))
(asserts! (<= amount (var-get kUSD-balance)) (err u107))

)
(update-exchange-rate)

(total-repay (+ amount fee)))
(try! (token-transfer? kUSD-token tx-sender (as-contract tx-sender) total-repay))
(set! kUSD-balance (+ (var-get kUSD-balance) total-repay))
(set! total-borrows (- (var-get total-borrows) amount))
(map-set borrower-positions tx-sender (merge position {kusd-debt: (- (get kusd-debt position) amount)}))
)
)
(update-exchange-rate)

liquidate (user):
(update-exchange-rate)
(let ((position (unwrap! (map-get? borrower-positions user) (err u103))))
(asserts! (not (is-healthy? position)) (err u109))
(let ((debt (get kusd-debt position))
(collateral (get sbtc-collateral position))
(penalty (/ (* collateral LIQUIDATION_PENALTY) u10000)))
(set! total-borrows (- (var-get total-borrows) debt))
(map-set borrower-positions user {sbtc-collateral: u0, kusd-debt: u0})
(try! (token-transfer? sBTC-token (as-contract tx-sender) tx-sender (+ collateral penalty)))
(try! (reputation-sbt/burn user))
)
)
(update-exchange-rate)

We also need the helper functions:

text
  calculate-borrowing-power (user):
    (let ((position (unwrap! (map-get? borrower-positions user) (err u103))))
      (let ((collateral-value (/ (* (get sbtc-collateral position) (oracle/get-sbtc-price)) u1000000))
            (reputation (reputation-sbt/get-reputation user)))
        (let ((base-limit (/ (* collateral-value BASE_LTV) u10000))
              (reputation-bonus (/ (* base-limit (get-reputation-multiplier reputation)) u10000)))
          (+ base-limit reputation-bonus)
        )
      )
    )

  is-healthy? (position):
    (let ((collateral-value (/ (* (get sbtc-collateral position) (oracle/get-sbtc-price)) u1000000))
          (debt (get kusd-debt position)))
      (>= (* collateral-value LIQUIDATION_THRESHOLD) (* debt u10000))
    )
Note: In is-healthy?, we are using:

text
    collateral-value * LIQUIDATION_THRESHOLD / 10000 >= debt
Because LIQUIDATION_THRESHOLD is in basis points.

This is the simplified design.

We'll implement this.

Now, we write the code in Clarity.

We'll create the contract file: lending-pool.clar

We'll assume the following constants:

text
  (define-constant PRECISION u1000000000000000000)   ;; 1e18
But note: we are using 1e18 for the exchange rate, but the kUSD and sBTC tokens might have different decimals.

We assume kUSD and sBTC have 6 decimals.

The oracle price for sBTC is in microUSD (so 1 sBTC = 40000000000 microUSD, meaning $40,000).

We'll adjust the calculations accordingly.

Let's write the code.

⚙️ TIME-BASED INTEREST ALGORITHMS
1. Interest Calculation Formula
clarity
;; Calculate accrued interest
(define-private (calculate-accrued-interest (principal uint) (start-block uint) (current-block uint) (apr uint))
  (let*
    (
      (blocks-elapsed (- current-block start-block))
      (blocks-per-year u52560)  ;; 10 min blocks × 6 × 24 × 365
      (interest-numerator (* principal apr blocks-elapsed))
      (interest-denominator (* blocks-per-year u10000))  ;; 10000 = 100% in basis points
    )
    (/ interest-numerator interest-denominator)
  )
)
2. Reputation-Based APR Tiers
clarity
;; APR in basis points (100 = 1%)
(define-constant BRONZE_APR u700)   ;; 7.00% APR
(define-constant SILVER_APR u600)   ;; 6.00% APR  
(define-constant GOLD_APR u490)     ;; 4.90% APR

;; Get borrower APR based on reputation
(define-read-only (get-borrower-apr (user principal))
  (let ((reputation (unwrap! (map-get? reputation-data user))))
    (if (is-eq (get tier reputation) "gold")
      GOLD_APR
      (if (is-eq (get tier reputation) "silver")
        SILVER_APR
        BRONZE_APR
      )
    )
  )
)
3. Lender Interest Distribution
clarity
;; Calculate lender APY based on utilization
(define-read-only (calculate-lender-apy)
  (let*
    (
      (utilization (if (> total-kusd-deposited u0)
        (/ (* total-kusd-borrowed u10000) total-kusd-deposited)
        u0
      ))
      (base-apy u200)    ;; 2% base
      (utilization-bonus (/ (* utilization u1000) u10000))  ;; 0-10% bonus
    )
    (+ base-apy utilization-bonus)  ;; 2-12% APY
  )
)
